ositive thinking can improve resilience and problem-solving. For example, when coding a small task, stay focused and keep it simple:

Python Code:

python
Copy code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

name = input("Enter name: ")
print(greet(name))
This shows how positivity and breaking tasks into steps can make problems easier to solve.
